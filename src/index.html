            I am a senior software engineer at C.H. Robinson, working on the Tools & Patterns team.
            There, I create shared libraries and templates for .NET products to help delivery teams 
            be more productive and reduce boilerplate code.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I like to play games, mountain bike, read, and work on music production or model train projects.

            My wife and I also love to spend time traveling, eating good food, and watching TV with the pups.

            <span class="text-green">// 2016 -> Present</span>
            <p>
                I started at C.H. Robinson working on the Compensation delivery team. There, we used React/Redux,
                .NET Service Stack APIs, and SQL Server to
                create a compensation planning tool that managers could use to plan their employess compensation structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a couple of years, the Compensation team was dispersed to other teams in the org. I joined the Orders
                delivery team. There, I was responsible with managing change into our Orders module inside of a product called
                Navisphere. I worked with older technologies like WinForms, WPF, and still Service Stack APIs, but also 
                newer front end technologies like Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, and build techologies using NodeJS like Webpack
                and Jest. This was before things like create-react-app were around.
            </p>
            <p>
                After another couple of years, a new team was created called Tools & Patterns. Their mission was to create shared libraries
                and template that developers in the org could use to stamp out products quickly, with prebuilt GitHub repositories and CICD pipelines.
                Things like CORS, Authn and Authz, containerization, and secret storage would all be created up front.
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined this team after a couple of years on Orders, with the hopes of combining my experience "in the trenches" on a delivery team to solve problems 
                for all of the delivery teams in the org. I work not only in front end and back end technologies, but in mentoring developers on patterns such as
                event sourcing, domain driven design, and command queueing.

            <p>
                I joined Connexions Loyalty as a senior software engineer with the ability to architect backend systems, all in .NET.

            <p>
                At Intergize Digital, I worked primarily on an ASP.NET product called NewsSynergy. This was a mobile application development platform
                that could be used by news organizations owned by Nexstar Broadcasting to create and manage their mobile apps across iOS and Android.
                Users could create different sections in the application, and hook up content to the application via RSS. Changes to the app would automatically
                be published to Apple and Google. This provided a common interface for users.

            <span class="text-green">// 2010 -> 2013</span>
            <p>
                I started as a .NET support engineer at Appolis in 2010. Appolis has a product called WithoutWire that is used for warehouse inventory
                management. This WMS would also syncronize with Dynamics GP. I was responsible for many roles in my tenure at Appolis.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started as a support engineer, where I tested the system to search and fix bugs. I also was responsible for handling technical support 
                for customers. Technologies were all .NET based - Microsoft .NET Micro-Framework for apps on PDAs (before smartphones were a thing), ASP.NET
                WinForms websites, SQL Server, and IT support.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, I also took on learning more IT based skills to help support my understanding of .NET. I completed a migration from hardware based servers
                to VM Ware virtual machines (on-site). Along with managing the Exchange server, domain controller, the active directory forest, and other server technologies.
